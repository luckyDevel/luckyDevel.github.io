# Slartibartfast

Slartibartfast is a very, very old and supposedly even more mysterious man from the mythical and mysterious planet Magrathea, which happens to be very, very old, too.
As a retirement project (or whatever one might want to call what he is doing), he tries desperately to save the galaxy, which, from a very distinct point of view, works out.
However, it is a full desaster.
