# Slartibartfast

Slartibartfast is a very, very old and supposedly even more mysterious man from the mythical and mysterious planet Magrathea, which happens to be very, very old, too.
As a retirement project (or whatever one might want to call what he is doing), he tries desperately to save the galaxy, which, from a very distinct point of view, works out.
However, it is a full desaster.

## Character quote

> Perhaps I'm old and tired, but I think that the chances of finding out what's actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say, "Hang the sense of it," and keep yourself busy.
> I'd much rather be happy than right any day.
